///HERE IS A RECIPE FOR GINGER SNAPS TO USE
/*
 
 Ingredients

     1 1/2 sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature
     1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar, divided
     1/4 cup (50 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar
     1/3 cup (113 grams) unsulphured molasses (NOT blackstrap)
     1 large egg
     1/2 teaspoon fine salt
     2 teaspoons baking soda
     1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
     1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
     1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
     2 1/4 cups (286 grams) all-purpose flour

 Directions

     Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

     In a large bowl, use an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to beat the butter, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the molasses and egg and beat until combined. Add in the salt, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and flour, and beat until combined.

     Place the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a shallow dish. Scoop the dough into 1 1/2 tablespoon balls and roll in the sugar before placing on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of room for spread. Bake for 15 minutes or until the cookies are spread and the surface looks crackled.

     Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days.
